### üß† Recommendations

1. **Use a pretrained ResNet18**
   Transfer learning will likely boost performance to **70‚Äì80%+** quickly.

2. **Add Class Weights or Sampler**
   Especially if your dataset has imbalanced class distribution.

3. **Experiment with LR Schedulers**
   Use a `ReduceLROnPlateau` or `StepLR` scheduler after val loss plateaus.

4. **Early Stopping**
   Implement early stopping at \~epoch 8 to avoid overfitting.

5. **Visual Diagnostics**

   * Add **confusion matrix**
   * Plot **loss curves** and **accuracy curves**


# Actions taken on the modified script for better accuracy
 a. Fine-tune more layers
Instead of freezing all layers, unfreeze the last few:

```
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if "layer4" in name or "fc" in name:
        param.requires_grad = True
    else:
        param.requires_grad = False
```
This keeps early layers (edges/textures) frozen but allows deeper layers to adapt to skin features.

c. Add data augmentation (not the same as adding images)
Before transforms.Resize(...), add:

```
transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
transforms.RandomRotation(10),
transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2),
```
This improves generalization without collecting new data.
