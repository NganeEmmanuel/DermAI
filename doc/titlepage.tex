% \begin{justify}
Skin cancer is one of the most common and potentially deadly forms of cancer worldwide, with early detection playing a critical role in improving patient outcomes. However, accurate diagnosis often requires specialized medical expertise, which may not be readily accessible in many parts of the world. This study presents the development of a skin lesion detection and classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), aiming to support early and accessible diagnosis through automated analysis of skin images.

The system was trained on a publicly available dataset of dermoscopic images and utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet18 architecture to classify lesions into multiple diagnostic categories. Image preprocessing techniques were applied to normalize input data, and data augmentation was used to improve model generalization. The training process was conducted using supervised learning techniques with categorical cross-entropy loss and evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The final model achieved a validation accuracy of 75\% and demonstrated consistent performance on the test set, indicating its potential as a supportive diagnostic tool. The implementation includes both a command-line inference tool for researchers and a user-friendly graphical interface for clinicians or general users.

This project contributes to the growing field of medical AI by offering a cost-effective and scalable approach to skin lesion classification. It highlights the viability of CNN-based solutions in medical imaging, particularly in low-resource settings. Future improvements may include incorporating explainability features, expanding to multi-modal inputs, and validating the system in clinical environments.
